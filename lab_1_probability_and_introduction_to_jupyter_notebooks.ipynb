        "Welcome to the Foundations of Machine Learning course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model a dataset with the purpose of prediction. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this Notebook, we will use a dataset to compute basic probability quantities. This will allow you to see how those concepts we review in the Lecture can actually be translated to Python code so that you can automate computation of basic probabilities. This will later on be useful to build basic probabilistic prediction models."

If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) that are based on the standard console.

        "#### Question 1 Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, designed Python with several goals in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Readability**: Python was designed to be a highly readable language. Guido wanted to create a programming language with a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Simplicity**: Python's design philosophy emphasizes simplicity and minimizing the complexity of code. The idea was to enable developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Versatility**: Python was intended to be a versatile, general-purpose language capable of handling a wide range of tasks. It was designed to support multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Open Source**: Python was created as an open-source project, fostering a collaborative and community-driven development process. This openness allowed Python to grow and evolve with input from a global community of developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Cross-Platform**: Python was designed to be a cross-platform language, meaning that code written in Python can run on various operating systems without modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Ease of Integration**: Python was intended to be easy to integrate with other languages and systems. It has robust support for calling C/C++ code and can be used for scripting and automation tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The name \"Python\" has its origin in Guido van Rossum's fondness for the British comedy group Monty Python. He chose the name while working on the language in the late 1980s. Guido wanted a name that was unique and a bit humorous, and \"Python\" fit the bill.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is not a compiled language in the traditional sense. It is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed by an interpreter at runtime. However, Python code can be compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the Python interpreter. This compilation step occurs automatically when you run a Python script.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is indeed an object-oriented language. It supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Python's support for OOP makes it a versatile language for designing and implementing object-oriented software systems."

However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

        "#### Question 2 Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **NumPy**:\n",
        "   - Functionality: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing. It provides multi-dimensional array objects (called NumPy arrays) and numerous functions for array manipulation. It supports high-performance mathematical operations like linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Matplotlib**:\n",
        "   - Functionality: Matplotlib is a library for creating 2D graphics and plots. It allows you to generate a wide range of static, dynamic, interactive, and high-quality charts and graphs. Matplotlib is often used in conjunction with NumPy for visualizing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **SciPy**:\n",
        "   - Functionality: SciPy builds upon NumPy and offers many advanced features for scientific and engineering computing. It includes tools for optimization, signal processing, statistical analysis, integration, interpolation, and more. SciPy's modules make it easy to tackle complex scientific computing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pandas**:\n",
        "   - Functionality: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It introduces two main data structures, DataFrame and Series, making data operations more straightforward. Pandas provides powerful tools for data filtering, manipulation, merging, and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the \"pylab\" library, it's actually considered outdated and not recommended for use anymore. In the past, it attempted to merge NumPy, Matplotlib, and some SciPy functionality into one namespace for interactive computing and visualization. However, the current best practice is to import these libraries separately to have better control and organization of your code. Therefore, there's no need to specifically focus on the \"pylab\" library; instead, you can directly use NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Pandas to accomplish related tasks."

        "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the programming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

        "#### Question 3 Answer\n",
        "Jupyter is an open-source project that provides a web-based interactive computing environment. It was invented to address several key goals in the world of data science, scientific computing, and interactive computing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Interactive Computing**: Jupyter allows users to interact with code, data, and visualizations in an interactive and exploratory manner. It provides a platform for iterative data analysis and experimentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Documented Workflows**: Jupyter notebooks enable users to create documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. This makes it an ideal tool for creating reproducible research and data analysis reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Support for Multiple Languages**: While Jupyter is closely associated with Python, it supports a wide range of programming languages, making it versatile for various tasks. You can use Jupyter with languages like R, Julia, and many others.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Visualization**: Jupyter provides integration with libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, allowing users to create interactive data visualizations directly within their notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Educational Use**: Jupyter is widely used in education to teach programming, data analysis, and scientific computing. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to learn and experiment with code.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Collaboration**: Jupyter notebooks can be shared with others, facilitating collaboration in research and data analysis projects. This makes it easier to disseminate findings and work together on code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Jupyter project encompasses a variety of components, with Jupyter Notebook being the most well-known. Some of the core components of the Jupyter project include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Jupyter Notebook**: The web application that allows you to create and interact with notebooks. It supports multiple programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **JupyterLab**: An integrated development environment (IDE) that builds upon Jupyter Notebook's capabilities, providing a more flexible and extensible interface for interactive computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **IPython**: The interactive computing environment for Python, which was the precursor to Jupyter. IPython is still an important part of Jupyter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Jupyter Widgets**: A framework for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks to enhance user interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **nbconvert**: A tool for converting Jupyter notebooks to various formats, including HTML, PDF, and slideshows.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to Python, two other languages closely involved in the Jupyter project are R and Julia. Jupyter provides kernels (execution engines) for these languages, allowing users to create notebooks and work with them just as they would with Python. This multi-language support makes Jupyter a powerful tool for a wide range of data analysis and scientific computing tasks."

We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time).

The scatter plot of deaths vs year that we created above can be seen as a *joint* probability distribution. We represent a joint probability using the notation $P(Y=y, T=t)$ or $P(y, t)$ for short. Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002? Or any other question that may occur to us. Again we can easily use pandas to ask such questions.\n"

If you are predicting a numerical rating (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 10), you might consider linear regression or other regression techniques. If you are predicting categories (e.g., classifying into high, medium, or low ratings), then classification techniques like logistic regression or decision trees could be used.\n",

        "5. **Build and Train the Model**: Train your chosen model using the training data. The model learns the relationships between the selected features and IMDB_Rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression, accuracy for classification) to assess how well your model predicts IMDB_Rating on a separate validation or test dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Use the Model for Predictions**: Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data to estimate IMDB_Rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Regularization and Tuning**: Depending on your model, you may need to apply regularization techniques or hyperparameter tuning to improve performance and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, you should use a conditional distribution where IMDB_Rating is the target variable, and the distribution is conditioned on the relevant features from your dataset. The choice of model and techniques will depend on your specific goals and the nature of your data."
